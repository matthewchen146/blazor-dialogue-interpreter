// comments with double slash

// conversation name must be defined first
// this is the entry point for the dialogue
@conversation Greeting

// characters enter the conversation
// the name is optional, and can be edited directly outside of the dialogue
@enter personA "Takeshi" // comments can also go on the side
@enter personB "Mary"

// "speak" changes who is talking (changes the name in the header)
@speak personA 
Hello %personB.
@speak personB
How are you doing %personA?
@speak personA
I'm doing fine.
// new lines will pause and prompt player to interact to continue i.e. next
How about you?

// empty new lines are ignored

@speak personB 
Well, I could be better...

// options can be defined for the player to choose from
// when chosen, they will fire events in the game, 
// as well as jump to labeled parts of the dialogue

// use _ if you don't want to jump and just continue after the options
@option _ "I see... "

// jumps to the label named "problem", and displays on a button "What's wrong?"
@option problem "What's wrong?" 

// jumps to the label named "fight"
@option fight "I don't care! "

@speak personB
Yea..

// jumps to label named "end"
@jump end

@label problem
@speak personB
I am so very hungry right now..
I could eat a horse perhaps!
@speak personA
I don't know if you could do that
@jump end

@label fight
@speak personB
Wow. If you don't care, you shouldn't have asked.
Also, we are no longer friends
@speak personA
Bye

// if a jump doesn't appear before a label, it will continue through that label

@label end
And they moved on with their lives
